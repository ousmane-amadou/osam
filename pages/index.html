          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p> Hello world! My name is Ousmane Amadou, but most people call me Oz. I am a self-taught developer and
            UX designer based in Toronto. I started experimenting with code around 8 years ago.
            Since then I have worked on a variety of projects including games, mobile apps, and web apps. Recently, I have
            been doing freelance web development for small businesses and startups. In the Fall, I worked on the
            front-end of rabbithole for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/datax-one/about/">DataX</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am cognitive science (computational stream) and statistics student at the University of Toronto focusing on
            Human-Computer Interaction. During my time at the UofT, I have been involved with the ACM-ICPC team,
            numerous hackathons, and two startup incubation programs. Right now, I am working on something new
            at The Hatchery Accelerator.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I like to get involved in musical performance. I can play a handful of instruments including the guitar
            trumpet, and the voice. In the past, I have played for jazz bands, choirs, and musicals. These days, however, I by like to
            DJ part-time for student organizations.
